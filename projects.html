  <p>PacMan Factory for making pacmen You are given a starter.html code. When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman. You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable.

    How To Load the starter.html page. From here you can interact with the game by adding Pacmen and starting the game. Future improvements include adding css grid structure to move the PacMen along a line to "consume" fruits. It also includes PacMen appearing on several grid rows to move along for this purpose.

   <p>Eyes Exercise on eyes

    This exercise with MIT Professional Certification course in Full-Stack Engineering with MERN, creates 2 eyes that follow the movement of your mouse on the screen.
    
    How to Run Load the index.html file. Notice the eyes follow your mouse as it moves across the screen. Future improvements would include adding interactive features to the page, such as blinks on click.

   <p>Real Time Bus Tracker
    Map for tracking stops between MIT and Harvard
    When button "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard" is pressed you will see the map marker move to show the bus stop between MIT's campus and Harvard University. The map marker stops at each bus stop along the way. The projects uses Mapbox and geographical coordinates to assist in the visual movement along the bus stop route.
    
    How To
    Load the index.html web page. When you click the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" you can see the map marker move. Additional improvements include marking the route back from Harvard to MIT. Additionally, adding the ability to click on each marker as it moves to get more specific information about each bus stop would be an improvement.
